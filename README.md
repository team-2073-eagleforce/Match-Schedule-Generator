# Instructions for uploading onto android tablets:
- Connect the tablet to the computer using the charger.

slide down.
- you will see "Charging this device via USB"
underneath it: "tap for other USB options." (other options might also show up as "system * connected as media device")
- There will be an option for file transfer.
- For windows there will be a new folder called "Fire", drag the match schedule file into the downloads
- For chromebook there will also be a new folder called fire that you can drag the match schedule file into
- Mac also allows you to upload files, but idk how (it should be similar to windows, but the tab for file transfer on Mac might look different)
